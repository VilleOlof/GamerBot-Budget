# GamerBot-Budget
This is a C# Remake Of SGC GamerBot, That I Did For Fun.  
Check Out Their Offical Repo Here: https://github.com/stamdiscord/GamerBot2.0  

This Is Missing A Few Features, Most Notably  
* Ticket System
* VoiceChat Creation System
* More Moderator Specific Commands
* Database Integration

A Few Of These Can Be Made Within A Few Hours.  
But DB Integration Wouldn't Be Too Hard Since You Can Implement 'IData In DataManager.cs'.  

Currently The .JSON Data Files Contain Dummy Data For Testing Purposes.  
Everything Inside Of /Frames/... Is From The Official Repo.

### Building And Running
* Clone The Repo.  
* Open Up Program.cs(L:23)  
* Change "DiscordTestBot" To Your ENV Token Key
* Build The Solution

And It Should Just Work.  
The Bot Is Not Tested In Multiple Server At Once, Features May Overlap Or Not Work.
